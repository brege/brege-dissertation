Neutron star-black hole binaries are one of the primary sources of 
gravitational waves.  
These systems can also produce high-powered,
bright electromagnetic counterparts via short-duration gamma
ray bursts and kilonovae, the latter of which is powered by the production
of heavy r-process elements.
We consider systems where we assume the same initial black hole mass
and spin for all simulations, varying the equation of state of the neutron
star companion.
We use three finite-temperature, composition-dependent, nuclear-theory based
equations of state (SFHo, DD2, FSU2.1) and assume neutron star masses
in the range $1.2 - 1.4 M_\odot$.
We show that ejecta masses mostly agree with predictions fit from simpler 
equations of state, although not all, while the ejecta velocities do agree with the 
updated fitting-formula.
We also determine that the dynamics of bound matter may be of particular future interest,
where the bound tail material (fallback) and the early-stage circularization 
of fluid near the horizon (protodisk) admixture is highly energetic and 
optically bright in neutrinos.
This distinction could be important in understanding the origins of 
gamma ray bursts.
