\begin{table}

	\caption[Initial parameters of binaries used in this survey]{
		Initial parameters of the binaries studied in this paper. 
		$M_{\rm NS}$ the ADM mass of an isolated neutron star with the same equation of state and baryon mass as the neutron star under
		consideration, $N_{\rm orbits}$ is the number of orbits up to the point at which $0.01M_\odot$ has been accreted by the black hole,
		$\Omega_0$ is the initial angular velocity, and $M=M_{\rm BH}+M_{\rm NS}$. We use the same resolution for each simulation: $\Delta x_{\rm dis} = 245{\rm m}$ is the typical grid resolution in the laboratory frame
		for the finest level of refinement used during the disruption of the neutron star (see Sec.~\ref{sec:hydro-amr} for more detail on the grid structure).}
