\section{Initial Configuration}
\label{sec:initial-config}

The models considered in this survey consider those black hole whose Christodoulou mass is $M_{\rm BH} = 7 M_\odot$ with an orbitally-aligned, prograde dimensionless spin of $\chi_{\rm BH} = 0.9$  The black hole mass is in the range of masses i of X-ray binary observations, while the spin is chosen to yield maximal disruption of the neutron star.  We choose a naming scheme such that model M12-M7-S9-FSU21 represents an ADM neutron star mass of $M_{\rm NS} = 1.2 M_\odot$, a black hole of mass and dimensionless spin $M_{\rm BH} = 7 M_\odot$ and $\chi_{\rm BH} = 0.9$, and the FSU2.1 neutron star equation of state.  In Table \ref{tab:id}, we provide a list of the initial values for the models used in this paper.

The TOV equations which govern gravitational equilibrium under general relativity are solved with an in-house solver in \SpEC to produce the initial central density $\rho_c$, neutron star baryon mass $M^b_{\rm NS}$ and radius $R_{\rm NS}$ via a basic root solving technique in density given an available finite-temperature, nuclear theory-based equation of state table.  
The neutron star fluid is assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, irrotational, cold ($T = 0.1 {\rm MeV}$) and in $\beta$-equilibrium.
We start with an initial separation between the two objects that is fairly close ($d \sim 80 {\rm km}$), where the binary is in a quasicircular orbit
(i.e. small eccentricities $e \sim 0.01$).
All models studied here orbit $5 - 6$ times during inspiral, before the neutron star begins to tidally disrupt and accrete onto the black hole.

\begin{table}
	\begin{center}
	\caption[Initial parameters of binaries used in this survey]{
		Initial parameters of the binaries studied in this work. 
		$M_{\rm NS}$ is the ADM mass of an isolated neutron star with the same equation of state and baryon mass as the neutron star under
		consideration, $N_{\rm orbits}$ is the number of orbits up to the point at which $0.01M_\odot$ has been accreted by the black hole,
		$\Omega_0$ is the initial angular velocity, and the system mass is $M=M_{\rm BH}+M_{\rm NS}$. We use the same resolution for each simulation: $\Delta x_{\rm dis} = 160{\rm m}$ is the typical grid resolution in the laboratory frame
		for the finest level of refinement used during the disruption of the neutron star (see Sec.~\ref{sec:hydro-amr} for more detail on the grid structure).}

\section{Merger dynamics}
\label{sec:merger-dynamics}

All of our models disrupt outside the inner most stable circular orbit of the black hole.  All of our models were evolved with the same minimum grid spacing of $\Delta x_{\rm dis} = 245{\rm m}$ on the innermost level of refinement, in the grid coordinates.  In the inertial frame, the average minimum grid spacing is typically around $\sym 150-200 {\rm m}$.  This is because in the grid frame, the grid spacing gets coarser in the direction in which the tidal stream expands and gets finer in the direction it contracts.

Note the distortion (and rotation) of the finite volume subdomain boundaries in the finest, innermost level, since the fluid is evolved in the coordinates of the (non-rotating) pseudo-spectral grid and we are viewing the systems in the inertial frame.  Also note the difference in length scales between models at merger time.

\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:rho_M12} we show the snapshot of each $1.2 M_\odot$ model on the equatorial plane when 50\% of the neutron star material has been accreted onto the black hole.  In Figure \ref{fig:rho_M14}, Model M14-M7-S9-FSU21 shows the poofiest, outer tail, measuring $\sym 20 {\rm km}$ across, while M12-M7-S9-DD2 measures at $\sym 12 {\rm km}$ in breadth.  The infalling stream near the horizon gets very narrow, and as such caused a number of our softest models to become too difficult to evolve.  Both SFHx as well as the M14-M7-S9-SFHo models did not proceed past merger beyond a few fractions of a millisecond.  

Consulting Figure \ref{fig:MultGammavsRho}, while all models soften near the fiducial density, the most drastic change in the high-density infalling region occurs in SFHx.  In our studies, the measured average temperature of the soft $1.4 M_\odot$ models was much higher near merger time (at which point the average temperature in all models reaches a maximum), and could indicate that the simulations were poorly resolved, at least in the innermost levels of the finite volume grid.  Therefore, we do not include the snapshots for M14-M7-S9-SFHo of M14-M7-S9-SFHx, while the snapshot for M12-M7-S9-SFHx is only included because it was well-behaved up to merger.

\end{figure*}

Shortly after the merger, between the time of merger and the first local minimum of the accretion rate and average temperature, we derefine the innermost finite volume level by a factor of two.
The fluid begins to circularize $\sym (3-4) {\rm ms}$ after merger in all models.
We perform a second derefinement by a factor of two more at 
this stage as well, since the material becomes less dense and easier to resolve.

		\caption[Properties of the dynamical ejecta and post merger remnant]{
			Properties of the dynamical ejecta and post merger remnant. $M_{\rm BH}^f$ and  $\chi_{\rm BH}^f$  are the mass and dimensionless spin of the black hole,
			and $M_{\rm out}^f$ is the baryon mass remaining outside of the black hole. Those quantities are measured at the first minima of the accretion rate onto the black hole,
			before circularization of the accretion disk. The baryon mass outside of the black hole immediately after disk formation (which is a more vaguely defined
			time) is typically $10\%-20\%$ lower than $M_{\rm out}^f$. $M_{\rm ej}$ is the mass of the dynamical ejecta, and $\langle v/c\rangle_{\rm ej}$. All these properties are nearly constant, from about $1\,{\rm ms}$ after the merger. Bracketed numbers for
			$M_{\rm out}^f$ and $M_{\rm ej}$ show semi-analytical predictions for the mass outside of the black hole $10\,{\rm ms}$ after merger~\cite{Foucart2012},
			and the ejected mass~\cite{Kawaguchi:2016}, while bracketed numbers for $M_{\rm BH}^f$ and $\chi_{\rm BH}^f$ are semi-analytical predictions
			from~\cite{Pannarale:2014}. Those values were calculated from the equations in~\cite{Pannarale:2014} using a root-finding code for both the innermost stable spherical orbit and the reported quantities.  Relative errors in the determination of $M_{\rm ej}$ are $\sim 20\%$, the black holes properties are
			accurate to $\sim 1\%$, and other quantities have relative errors of $\sim 10\%$.

\section{Outflow analysis: properties of the ejecta}
\label{sec:tail-analysis}

In this section, we consider the ejecta that results from the tidal disruption of the neutron star, leaving aside the second source of late-stage ejecta which occurs via neutrino driven winds and magnetic effects in accretion disk outlfows.  As our models do not incorporate magnetohydrodynamics and since we only implement a simple leakage scheme to approximately capture the effects of neutrino cooling on the post-merger remnant of Section \ref{sec:diskanalysis}, we do not evolve the remaining models beyond $10 {\rm ms}$ passed the onset of merger.

For those models that evolved out to $5 {\rm ms}$ passed merger, we find that at that time, the ejecta mass $M_{\rm ej}$ is roughly constrained between $\sym (4 - 8) \times 10^{-2} M_\odot$.
In table \ref{tab:results}, we display our measured results at $5 {\rm ms}$ after measure compared to the predicted results from the fitting formulae.  
As described by the fitting formulae, the stiffer, finite-temperature equations of state do indeed disrupt further outside the ISCO, while the softer one disrupts much closer and results in more interaction between the protodisk and the fallback material.


\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{images/unbound-mass-vs-Ye}
	\caption[Composition of the ejecta]{
		Electron fraction $Y_e$ of the ejecta measured 5 ms after merger.  We note that all of the matter peaks in the $Y_e \sym 0.05$ range, where M12-M7-S9-DD2 has the largest electron fraction range ($0.011 - 0.07$) while neither FSU21 models produce ejecta with $Y_e < 0.05$.
	}
	\label{fig:Yehisto}
\end{figure}

As in previous simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers, the ejecta in our models is very neutron rich, with a density-weighted average electron fraction of $Y_e \sim 0.05$).  
In Figure \ref{fig:Yehisto}, we show the (logarithmic) distribution of matter over the chemical composition in the unbound material.  
Most of the ejecta has $Y_e < 0.7$ while none of it has $Y_e > 0.25$ --- where lighter r-process elements might be produced.
Therefore, r-process nucleosynthesis will produce 2nd and 3rd peak heavy elements in the ejecta, with little production of light elements in the 1st peak.  
The unbound material will be very opaque, leading to an electromagnetic transient to peak in the infrared by the r-process ~\cite{2013ApJ...775...18B}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{images/unbound-mass-vs-Vinf}
	\caption[Distribution of the asymptotic velocity of the ejecta]{
		Distribution of the asymptotic velocity of the ejecta measured 5 ms after merger.
	}
	\label{fig:vrhisto}
\end{figure}

We can also determine information about the infrared transient from the asymptotic velocity of the ejecta.  
Since greater velocities lead to faster expansion of the unbound material, the transient will be be shorter lived and have a larger amplitude~\cite{2013ApJ...775...18B,Barnes:2016}. 
In Figure \ref{fig:vrhisto}, the distribution of the ejecta velocities peak around $\langle v \rangle \sim 0.2 c$, with a broad distribution  $ 0 \le v \le 2 \langle v \rangle $.
Model M12-M7-S9-SFHo clearly has the least amount of ejecta.

The average kinetic energy of the ejecta was measured to lie between $3.7 \times 10^{52} {\rm ergs} $ for the SFHo model and $4.8 \times 10^{52} {\rm ergs} $ for the M12-M7-S9-DD2 model.  
The $1.4 M_\odot$ models had energies inside this range. 
The ejecta steadily cools within 1 ms after merger with to a steady temperature in the range of $T \sim (0.1 - 0.4) {\rm MeV}$, bounded by both FSU2.1 models in the higher range and the remaining models in the lower range.

		Angular distribution (in $\phi$) of the ejecta 5 ms after merger.  The ejecta spans approximately half of the zonal sky, with an angle of $\delta \phi \sim (0.99-1.13) \pi$, where M12-M7-S9-SFHo is the smallest and M12-M7-S9-FSU21 has the widest arc.

	\caption[Angular distribution (in $\theta$) of the ejecta]{
		Angular distribution (in $\theta$) of the ejecta 5 ms after merger.

	}
	\label{fig:costhetahisto}
\end{figure}


In addition, the ejecta geometry plays an integral role in the kilonova properties.  
In Figures \ref{fig:phihisto} and \ref{fig:costhetahisto}, we show the angular distribution of the ejecta in a spherical coordinate system in the inertial frame, where $\cos(\theta) = 0$ corresponds to the equator.  
Our results are consistent with previous black hole neutron star simulations, where the unbound material form a crescent with an opening zonal angle $\sym \pi$ and meridional angle $\sym \pi/4$.


\section{Post-merger remnant: formation of the protodisk and fallback}
\label{sec:disk-analysis}

Accretion of the fluid happens at a maximal rate during the merger. 
Around $ \sim 2.5$ ms after merger, this rapid accretion rate onto the black hole begins to slow and the average temperature of the fluid begins to reach a local minimum.
In our simulations, this window was the most difficult epoch of the merger, as the rate of expansion in the tail and then circularization are the horizon led to the creation of thousands of subdomains. 
\footnote{
We experienced an overwhelming number of memory issues here, and had to constantly but conservatively increase the number of computer processor cores used in each simulation.
That is, the number of fluid subdomains per processor quickly increased by a factor of (up to) six, requiring diligence in monitoring domain creation and increasing the requisite number of processors to improve the load balancing.
Performance suffers the worst during and shortly after merger, and makes gains as the resolution (i.e. subdomain size) was allowed to be lowered (increased) after maximal accretion and after circularization.  
For example, between the beginning of the plunge and the first derefinement, all simulations required $\sim 450000$ CPU hours to evolve 1 ms of merger (where timesteps shrink to nanoseconds), while the entire duration of the inspiral ($\sim 15 - 20$ ms) was performed with one 10th of this effort. 
}
Within the same timescale, the fluid eventually self-intersects when the higher density leading edge of the tail shocks against less dense fluid in the wider, bound portion of the tail.
This drives the fluid to slowly circularize into an early-evolution accretion disk, or protodisk.
On the timescale of $\sim 10-20$ ms post-merger, the protodisk continues to accrete, but also slowly cultivating fallback material from the bound portion of the tail.
The peak of the surface density of the disk begins to gradually advance outwards from the black hole horizon.
The disk secularizes from the tail over this $\sim 10$ ms period,
eventually forming an axisymmetric disk that could be evolved on much longer timescales if magnetic effects or an equivalent artificial viscosity scheme were added.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{images/density-of-disk}
	\caption[Density profiles of the protodisks 5 ms after merger]{
		Averaged density profiles of the protodisks 5 ms after merger.  The densest zone in the disks ranges $R \sim 30 - 50 {\rm km}$ from the center of the black hole (with a predicted final ISCO radius of $\sym 24 {\rm km}$).  
	}
	\label{fig:diskdensities}
\end{figure}

Because most of our simulations have yet to reach this approximate time of axisymmetrization ($\sim 10$ ms post-merger) where one normally measures the properties of the disk, we will at least analyze the protodisk and fallback properties at 5 ms past merger.
One argument we can \textit{a priori} make for this is demonstrated in [cite:foucart2014], where simulations with more massive post-
merger remnants rapidly form massive, hot inner disks and have less variability during the first $5-10$ ms, as with ours and in comparison to those with less massive disks yields.
The disk mass predictions of Equation \ref{e:mass_disk} are for the total bound baryonic mass remaining in the system, which include both the protodisk and fallback matter.
Roughly speaking, we define the disk as the bound matter having a minimum threshold of rotational velocity (i.e., $-1 < v_r/v_\phi < 0$) and a minimum temperature ($T>0.1$) in order to ditinguish the disk from the fallback,
while the fallback material is the remaining bound matter in the tidal tail.
At 5 ms past merger, our simulations yield a wide range of fallback material, in the range of $(32 - 71)\%$ fallback.  
The lowest fallback yield is that of the M12-M7-S9-SFHo model, while both $1.4 M_\odot$ models have the most amount of infalling matter at this time.
This is because more compact stars disrupt closer to the ISCO.

	\input{images/temperature-of-disk}
	\caption[Temperature profiles of the protodisks 5 ms after merger]{
		Averaged temperature profiles of the protodisks 5 ms after merger.  The temperature near the peaks of the density profiles is $T \sim (4-7) {\rm MeV}$, and becomes quite cool in the low density region ($r>75 {\rm km}$) outside the disk.  
	}
	\label{fig:disktemps}
\end{figure}

We see that in Figure \ref{fig:diskdensities}, most of the material is within 
$25 {\rm km} < r < 75{\rm km}$ for all models and drops off exponentially after that upper-bound, while the peak of the matter distribution is $r _{\rm disk} \sim (30 - 50) {\rm km}$.  
The composition is roughly constant outside the ISCO, $Y_e \sim 0.05 - 0.08$.  The temperature at the peak of the matter distribution varies as $T \sim (4-7) {\rm MeV}$ between runs, with M12-M7-S9-SFHo having the hottest protodisk and being only slightly more protonized. 
The neutrino luminosities at this time are high, $L_\nu \sim (1.5 - 5.5) \times 10^{53} {\rm egs/s}$,

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

The first simulations of neutron stars with multiple hot, temperature- and composition-dependent nuclear theory-based equations of state in black hole-neutron star mergers using a general relativistic fluid code were performed in this study.  
The mergers presented here all consider the same black hole parameters, with an orbitally aligned, relatively high black hole spin $\chi_{\rm BH} = 0.9$ and  mass $M_{\rm BH} = 7 M_\odot$, within the range of the most likely black hole masses.  
The neutron stars considered in this paper were evolved with the SFHo, DD2 and FSU2.1 equations of state with relatively low masses $M_{\rm NS} = (1.2,1.4) M_\odot$ over a wide range of compactnesess.  
These equations of state satisfy a number of observational, experimental and causal constraints.  
The ejecta of the five models that evolved far enough passed merger (for the fluid to circularize near the horizon) is very neutron-rich $Y_e = 0.05$, allowing for the robust production of heavy elements on the 2nd and 3rd peak of r-process nucleosynthesis.

We note that while we have implemented our improved algorithm to selectively evolve only non-vacuum subdomains, three of our models (M14-M17-S9-SFHo, M12-M17-S9-SFHx, and M14-M17-S9-SFHx) still had significant numerical error during merger. 
This is because our hot, compositio- dependent, tidally-disrupting material forms a much narrower tidal tail than other piecewise polytrope models.
An improvement to our algorithm would be to allow true adaptive mesh refinement, so that evolution subdomains could themselves shrink and expand given the average density gradient of the material inside.

\paragraph{Future work} 

The calculation of the gravitational waveform is in progress.  One simplification to the post-merger system is to  we are going to do is to turn off the fluid evolution and evolve only the metric quantities until the the waves propogate out to infinity.  For the neutrino emission, we did not include the effects of radiation transport in our simulations, which cannot be determnined by the relatively simple neutrino leakage scheme used in this work.  In order to capture an estimate of the production of electron-positron pairs in neutrino-driven winds near the spin axes of the black hole, evolving the fluid with a neutrino radiation code would improve the accuracy of the post-merger remnant evolution.  Furthermore, the effects of magnetic fields contribute heating through MRI turbulence.  Simulations of the post-merger remnant would be greatly enhanced with the inclusion of magnetohydrodynamics of an equivalent artificial viscosity scheme.
