\section{Initial Configuration}

The models considered in this survey consider those black hole whose Christodoulou mass is $M_{\rm BH} = 7 M_\odot$ with an orbitally-aligned, prograde dimensionless spin of $\chi_{\rm BH} = 0.9$  The black hole mass is in the range of masses i of X-ray binary observations, while the spin is chosen to yield maximal disruption of the neutron star.  We choose a naming scheme such that model M12-M7-S9-FSU21 represents an ADM neutron star mass of $M_{\rm NS} = 1.2 M_\odot$, a black hole of mass and dimensionless spin $M_{\rm BH} = 7 M_\odot$ and $\chi_{\rm BH} = 0.9$, and the FSU2.1 neutron star equation of state.  In Table \ref{tab:id}, we provide a list of the initial values for the models used in this paper.  

\begin{table}
	\begin{center}
	\caption[Initial parameters of binaries used in this survey]{
		Initial parameters of the binaries studied in this paper. 
		$M_{\rm NS}$ the ADM mass of an isolated neutron star with the same equation of state and baryon mass as the neutron star under
		consideration, $N_{\rm orbits}$ is the number of orbits up to the point at which $0.01M_\odot$ has been accreted by the black hole,
		$\Omega_0$ is the initial angular velocity, and $M=M_{\rm BH}+M_{\rm NS}$. We use the same resolution for each simulation: $\Delta x_{\rm dis} = 245{\rm m}$ is the typical grid resolution in the laboratory frame
		for the finest level of refinement used during the disruption of the neutron star (see Sec.~\ref{sec:hydro-amr} for more detail on the grid structure).}

\section{Merger dynamics}

Most of our systems evolve for 5 - 6 orbits before disruption of the neutron star by the black hole's tidal field.  All of our models disrupt outside the inner most stable circular orbit of the black hole.  All of our models were evolved with the same minimum grid spacing of $\Delta x_{\rm dis} = 245{\rm m}$ on the innermost level of refinement, in the spectral grid of the finite volume grid.  In the inertial frame, the average minimum grid spacing is typically around $\sym 150-200 {\rm m}$.  This is because in the grid frame, the grid spacing gets coarser in the direction in which the tidal stream expands and gets finer in the direction it contracts.


\begin{table}
	\begin{center}
	\caption[Properties of the dynamical ejecta and post merger remnant]{
		Properties of the dynamical ejecta and post merger remnant. $M_{\rm BH}^f$ and  $\chi_{\rm BH}^f$  are the mass and dimensionless spin of the black hole,
		and $M_{\rm out}^f$ is the baryon mass remaining outside of the black hole. Those quantities are measured at the first minima of the accretion rate onto the black hole,
		before circularization of the accretion disk. The baryon mass outside of the black hole immediately after disk formation (which is a more vaguely defined
		time) is typically $10\%-20\%$ lower than $M_{\rm out}^f$. $M_{\rm ej}$ is the mass of the dynamical ejecta, and $\langle v/c\rangle_{\rm ej}$. All these properties are nearly constant, from about $1\,{\rm ms}$ after the merger. Bracketed numbers for
		$M_{\rm out}^f$ and $M_{\rm ej}$ show semi-analytical predictions for the mass outside of the black hole $10\,{\rm ms}$ after merger~\cite{Foucart:2012},
		and the ejected mass~\cite{Kawaguchi:2016}, while bracketed numbers for $M_{\rm BH}^f$ and $\chi_{\rm BH}^f$ are semi-analytical predictions
		from~\cite{Pannarale:2014}. The analytical values provided in this table for the final mass and spin of the black hole were calculated from the equations in ~\cite{Pannarale:2013} using a root-finding code for both the innermost stable spherical orbit and those quantities.  Relative errors in the determination of $M_{\rm ej}$ are $\sim 20\%$, the black holes properties are
		accurate to $\sim 1\%$, and other quantities have relative errors of $\sim 10\%$.

		White regions are not covered by the finite volume grid, while some fluid subdomains overlap the excised region of the black hole which can be seen near the interface of inflowing matter and the horizon.  We bracket the baryon density between $\sym \rho_{\rm FMR}$ and the fiducial density, $10^{14.7} {\rm g\,cm^{-3}}$. Note the distortion (and rotation) of the finite volume subdomain boundaries in the finest, innermost level, since the fluid is evolved in the coordinates of the (non-rotating) pseudo-spectral grid and we are viewing the systems in the inertial frame.  Also note the difference in length scales between models at merger time.

In Figure \ref{fig:rho_M12} we show the snapshot of each $1.2 M_\odot$ model on the equatorial plane when 50\% of the neutron star material has been accreted onto the black hole.  In Figure \ref{fig:rho_M14}, Model M14-M7-S9-FSU21 shows the poofiest, outer tail, measuring $\sym 20 {\rm km}$ across, while M12-M7-S9-DD2 measures at $\sym 12 {\rm km}$ in breadth.  The infalling stream near the horizon gets very narrow, and as such caused a number of our softest models to become too difficult to evolve.  Both SFHx as well as the M14-M7-S9-SFHo models did not proceed past merger beyond a few fractions of a millisecond.  

Consulting Figure \ref{fig:MultGammavsRho}, while all models soften near the fiducial density, the most drastic change in the high-density infalling region occurs in SFHx.  In our studies, the measured average temperature of the soft $1.4 M_\odot$ models was much higher near merger time (at which point the average temperature in all models reaches a maximum), and could indicate that they were poorly resolved, at least in the innermost level of the finite volume grid.  Therefore, we do not include the snapshots for M14-M7-S9-SFHo of M14-M7-S9-SFHx, while the snapshot for M12-M7-S9-SFHx is only included because it was well-behaved at merger time.

	To add to the caption in Figure \ref{fig:rho_M12}, we note that the FSU2.1 profiles are represented with a $90^{\circ}$ counterclockwise rotation in the inertial frame.  This is done for sake of maintaining a similar aspect ratio to the others.  Note that FSU2.1 had the fewest number of orbits in our simulations (see Table \ref{tab:id}).

\end{figure*}

Shortly after the merger, between the time of merger and the first local minimum of the accretion rate and average temperature, we derefine the innermost finite volume level by a factor of two.  The fluid begins to circularize $\sym (3-4) {\rm ms}$ after merger.  We perform a second derefinement by a factor of two more at 
this stage as well, since the material becomes less dense and easier to resolve.

\section{Outflow analysis: properties of the ejecta}
\label{tailanalysis}

In this section, we consider the ejecta that results from the tidal disruption of the neutron star, leaving aside the second source of late-stage ejecta which occurs via neutrino driven winds and magnetic effects in accretion disk outlfows.  As our models do not incorporate magnetohydrodynamics and since we only implement a simple leakage scheme to approximately capture the effects of neutrino cooling on the post-merger remnant of Section \ref{sec:diskanalysis}, we do not evolve the remaining models beyond $10 {\rm ms}$ passed the onset of merger.

For those models that evolved out to $5 {\rm ms}$ passed merger, we find that at that time, the ejecta mass $M_{\rm ej}$ is roughly constrained between $\sym (4 - 8) \times 10^{-2} M_\odot$.  In table \ref{tab:results}, we display our measured results at $5 {\rm ms}$ after measure compared to the predicted results from the fitting formulae.  As described by the fitting formulae, the stiffer, finite-temperature equations of state do indeed disrupt further outside the ISCO, while the softer one disrupt much closer and result in more interaction between the protodisk and the fallback material.

\section{Discussion}

The first simulations of neutron stars with multiple hot, temperature- and composition-dependent nuclear theory-based equations of state in black hole-neutron star mergers using a general relativistic fluid code were performed in this study.  
The mergers presented here all consider the same black hole parameters, with an orbitally aligned, relatively high black hole spin $\chi_{\rm BH} = 0.9$ and  mass $M_{\rm BH} = 7 M_\odot$, within the range of the most likely black hole masses.  
The neutron stars considered in this paper were evolved with the SFHo, DD2 and FSU2.1 equations of state with relatively low masses $M_{\rm NS} = (1.2,1.4) M_\odot$ over a wide range of compactnesess.  
These equations of state satisfy a number of observational, experimental and causal constraints.  
The ejecta of the five models that evolved far enough passed merger (for the fluid to circularize near the horizon) is very neutron-rich $Y_e = 0.05$, allowing for the robust production of heavy elements on the 2nd and 3rd peak of r-process nucleosynthesis.

We note that while we have implemented our improved algorithm to selectively evolve only non-vacuum subdomains, three of our models (M14-M17-S9-SFHo, M12-M17-S9-SFHx, and M14-M17-S9-SFHx) still had significant numerical error during merger. 
This is because our hot, compositio- dependent, tidally-disrupting material forms a much narrower tidal tail than other piecewise polytrope models.
An improvement to our algorithm would be to allow true adaptive mesh refinement, so that evolution subdomains could themselves shrink and expand given the average density gradient of the material inside.

\paragraph{Future work} 

The calculation of the gravitational waveform is in progress.  One simplification to the post-merger system is to  we are going to do is to turn off the fluid evolution and evolve only the metric quantities until the the waves propogate out to infinity.  For the neutrino emission, we did not include the effects of radiation transport in our simulations, which cannot be determnined by the relatively simple neutrino leakage scheme used in this work.  In order to capture an estimate of the production of electron-positron pairs in neutrino-driven winds near the spin axes of the black hole, evolving the fluid with a neutrino radiation code would improve the accuracy of the post-merger remnant evolution.  Furthermore, the effects of magnetic fields contribute heating through MRI turbulence.  Simulations of the post-merger remnant would be greatly enhanced with the inclusion of magnetohydrodynamics of an equivalent artificial viscosity scheme.
